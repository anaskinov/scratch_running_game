# scratch_running_game
Just a simple project inspired by the Harvard introduction to computer science course (CS50x)

you move forward by tapping the left and right arrows. The scores on top track how many steps you take. make sure you take a step at a time (left = right) so that you go faster. 
If not (like in real life) you will start hopping which makes you go slower and if you do it too much you will stop and you have to readjust your steps.
Make sure you beat scratch!

Thank you!
